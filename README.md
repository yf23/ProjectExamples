State Space Search Problem Solver:
A set of solvers used to solve problems that can be modeled as state space search models. The implemented examples are Tower of Hanoi, n-puzzle and Sudoku. These examples are implemented by both Java and Python, and use various algorithms such as DFS, BFS, and A* searching algorithm. Especially for A* algorithm, different heuristic functions are tested in order to increase the efficiency.

License Plate Recognition based on Machine Learning:
Using machine learning technique to convert image of license plate of vehicles to text. Two types of machine learning classifiers are implemented: perceptron and Naive Bayes, and classifiers are combined by bagging method to increase accuracy. Also use Otsu's thresholding method and image segmentation to pre-process the image and extract single characters of license plate.

Memory Management:
Implemented a memory management package that has the same functionality as the standard C library malloc and free functions. Using circular linked list to ensure efficient dynamic memory allocation. Also automatically merge neighbor memory blocks to improve running time.

Simple Web Account System:
Use sessions and cookies to build a website with accounts. Only registered and logged in users are allowed to view and change contents. Also enables redirection to bring users to different pages. Built with PHP.
